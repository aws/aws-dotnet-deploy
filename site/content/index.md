# About the AWS Deploy Tool for .NET

**AWS Deploy Tool for .NET** is an interactive tool for the .NET CLI and the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio that helps deploy .NET applications with minimum AWS knowledge, and with the fewest clicks or commands.

### Key capabilities

AWS Deploy Tool has the following capabilities:

* **Compute recommendations for your application** – Get recommendations about the type of compute best suited for your application based on the application type.
* **Dockerfile  generation** - The tool will generate a Dockerfile if needed, otherwise an existing Dockerfile will be used.
* **Auto packaging and deployment** – The tool builds the deployment artifacts, generates a deployment CDK project, provisions the infrastructure, and deploys your application to the chosen AWS compute.
* **Repeatable and shareable deployments** – You can generate and modify AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) deployment projects to fit your specific use case. You can also version control your projects and share them with your team for repeatable deployments.
* **Help with learning AWS CDK for .NET!** - Gradually learn the underlying AWS tools that AWS Deploy Tool for .NET is built on, such as the AWS CDK.
