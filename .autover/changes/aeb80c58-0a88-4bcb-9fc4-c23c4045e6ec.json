        "Add the --load flag in docker buildx build because, unlike the standard docker build command, buildx doesn't automatically load the resulting image into the local Docker image store. When using buildx with certain docker drivers (like docker-container), the build process happens in a container, and the resulting image needs to be explicitly loaded into the local image store using --load."
